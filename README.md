# Physics Simulations

Some physics simulations that can easily be tranferred into a game or larger simulation. Some of the algorithms and code (like the collision engine) were designed and written by me from scratch, while some (like the stable fluids) were not. I have linked the original source of the algorithms or code where appropriate.
